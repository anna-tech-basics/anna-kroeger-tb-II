# Anna's Tech Basics II Exam Project
This repository contains my exam project code and respective report for Tech Basics 2. 
I have decided to build upon my project "Gym Girls" from Tech Basics 1 which can be found under https://github.com/anna-tech-basics/exam-project-tech-basics-1. 

Therefore this is the finalized version of the MVP for an application to unite women in fitness:

## How to navigate the MVP
